# BankingSystem

The project's theme is to develop an online banking system that caters to various needs and pain points faced by bank customers. The system aims to provide modules such as Personal Financial Management, Bill Payment and Donations, and Users and Information Management to enable users to perform banking functions conveniently.

The case description outlines several scenarios that highlight the challenges and requirements of an online banking system. These scenarios include checking salary deposits, paying bills, transferring funds, managing credit cards and loans, making donations, resolving credit card theft, categorizing expenses, and more.

The project consists of three milestones:

-Milestone 1: Requirements Engineering

Focuses on defining comprehensive requirements for the software.
Requires understanding banking processes and researching options offered to clients.
Covers modules like Users and Information Management, Credit Cards and Loans, Personal Financial Management, and Bill Payment and Donations.
Aims to document actionable, measurable, testable, and traceable requirements.


-Milestone 2: Design

Involves applying software design concepts and utilizing different Design Patterns.
Requires creating class diagrams for the application based on the defined requirements.


-Milestone 3: Prototype Development

Involves developing a prototype of the online banking system.
Focuses on front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Additional technologies can be used as long as the system is presented properly.
UI/UX evaluation is subjective and based on the Product Manager's opinion.
